## 📌 Final Project Overview

**Title:** Hybrid Ultrasonic–Radar Embedded System  
**Platform:** Microcontroller-based (C/C++, bare-metal with peripheral drivers)

### Focus Areas
- Sensor fusion (ultrasonic + radar)
- Real-time signal acquisition and processing
- Hardware–software integration
- Embedded timing, interrupts, and low-level control
- System-level validation and performance analysis

The final project demonstrates the integration of multiple sensing modalities into a cohesive embedded system with real-time constraints, supported by comprehensive documentation and justification.
